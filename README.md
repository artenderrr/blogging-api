# About
This project is a simple **API** for a **blogging platform**. It allows users to:
1. Create accounts.
2. Log into existing account.
3. View user profiles.
4. Manage blog posts.

# Prerequisites
- **uv** (a Python package and project manager) must be installed on your system.

# How to Build
1. **Download** the `tar.gz` source distribution file from the [Releases](https://github.com/artenderrr/blogging-api/releases) tab.
2. **Extract** the contents and open terminal in the extracted directory.
3. **Run** `uv run fastapi dev`.
- This automatically sets up the necessary virtual environment and installs all required dependencies.
